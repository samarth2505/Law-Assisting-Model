## Key Components

### **1. Petition Module**
The Petition Module serves as the foundational step in the pipeline. It focuses on ingesting, preprocessing, and classifying judicial case data to extract key legal insights.

#### **Step-by-Step Workflow**

1. **Data Loading**:
   - Import the judicial case dataset.
   - Use pandas to load the data into a DataFrame.
   ```python
   import pandas as pd
   df = pd.read_csv('final_judge_database.csv')
   ```

2. **Text Preprocessing**:
   - Clean the text data to make it suitable for model training.
   - Steps include converting text to lowercase and removing special characters.
   ```python
   import re
   def preprocess_text(text):
       text = text.lower()
       text = re.sub(r'[^a-z0-9 ]', '', text)
       return text

   df['cleaned_text'] = df['text_column'].apply(preprocess_text)
   ```

3. **Feature Extraction**:
   - Transform the text data into numerical features using vectorization techniques.
   ```python
   from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
   vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer()
   X = vectorizer.fit_transform(df['cleaned_text'])
   ```

4. **Train-Test Split**:
   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets for model evaluation.
   ```python
   from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
   X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, df['target'], test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
   ```

5. **Model Training**:
   - Train a classification model, such as Logistic Regression, on the prepared dataset.
   ```python
   from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
   model = LogisticRegression()
   model.fit(X_train, y_train)
   ```

6. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Evaluate the trained model using metrics like accuracy and classification reports.
   ```python
   from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, classification_report
   y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
   print("Accuracy:", accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred))
   print("Classification Report:
", classification_report(y_test, y_pred))
   ```

7. **Save Processed Data**:
   - Save the processed data and trained model for downstream use in the pipeline.
   ```python
   import joblib
   joblib.dump(model, 'petition_model.pkl')
   ```

This module outputs predictions and summarized insights, which feed into the subsequent ACT Module for deeper analysis.
Handles data preprocessing, classification, summarization, and key legal insights extraction.

#### Example Code:
```python
# Load dataset
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv('final_judge_database.csv')

# Preprocess text
def preprocess_text(text):
    text = text.lower()
    text = re.sub(r'[^a-z0-9 ]', '', text)
    return text

df['cleaned_text'] = df['text_column'].apply(preprocess_text)

# Train a classifier
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
model = LogisticRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

---

### **2. ACT Module**
Performs advanced analysis on the processed data, including feature engineering and visualization.

#### Example Code:
```python
# Feature Engineering
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer()
X = vectorizer.fit_transform(df['cleaned_text'])

# Train Random Forest Model
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
rf_model = RandomForestClassifier()
rf_model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Visualize Features
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.barh(feature_names, rf_model.feature_importances_)
plt.show()
```

---

### **3. LawBot**
An AI chatbot that uses the outputs of the Petition and ACT modules to provide legal insights interactively.

#### Example Code:
```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/chat', methods=['POST'])
def chat():
    user_input = request.json['input']
    response = "Processed legal data: " + user_input  # Replace with actual processing
    return jsonify({'response': response})

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```
